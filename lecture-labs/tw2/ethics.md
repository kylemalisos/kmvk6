## Kyle Malisos Thoughts on Ethics in Software Engineering
1. I am concerned about an increase of data collection leading to the removal of internet privacy.
2. I think that in the future we will see an increase of cyber attacks in politics and many other areas.
3. I'm worried about a "Big Brother" 1984 dystopian senario in the future.
