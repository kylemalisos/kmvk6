Group Plan: We will be meeting up on Monday to further discuss how we will delegate the work. But right now we will each do an activity diagram and then divide up how we will do the use case diagram, finish class diagram, erd, sequence diagram and state machine diagram. We have exchanged phone numbers so we will be in further contact later.
